# Conversational

Instructions on preparing conversation data for the code:

The package already includes processed converseation data to run the model. It includes four sub-categories from the Amazon dataset. If you are not using the model for new conversation data, you can just play with the code based on the four processed conversation datasets.

If you want to build your own conversation data — e.g., for other sub-categories of the Amazon dataset, or even datasets for other conversation scenarios — we have prepared the following package to achieve this goal, together with a figure to show the flow of the process.

The package for conversation data preparation can be downloaded in this URL:

And the flow of the data preparation process is shown as the following figure.
